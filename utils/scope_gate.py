"""File-backed, operator-armed scope gate for all traffic-sending tools.

Scope enforcement so a mis-targeted scan or crafted packet can't drift onto
an out-of-scope host.  Arming and disarming is a HUMAN authority action
performed from the Tool REPL (``scope on`` / ``scope off``) — it is
deliberately NOT exposed as an ``@framework_tool``, so the secretary agent
has no way to toggle or circumvent it.  When armed, every traffic-sending
tool consults this gate before firing; when disarmed (the default —
lab / VPN-practice mode) tools behave exactly as before.

Coverage
--------
Two entry points, both consulted before any wire traffic:

* :func:`check_send`  — packetcraft ``send_packet`` (a single destination IP
  extracted from a crafted packet; broadcast/multicast/loopback/link-local
  are never gated).
* :func:`check_scan`   — nmap / masscan / ffuf / hydra / ZAP open/spider/
  ajax/active-scan / send_raw.  Handles URL, bare hostname, IP, CIDR,
  hyphen-range, and whitespace/comma-separated lists.

Why file-backed, not a process singleton
----------------------------------------
The Brain sidecar and the Tool REPL are separate processes.  A tool call
dispatches to the Brain (the agent's normal path) when its socket is up and
falls back in-process otherwise.  A process-global singleton would only gate
the process that armed it.  The armed state is therefore persisted to
``scope/.armed_packet_scope.json`` so the operator's blessing — written from
the REPL — is authoritative in *every* process, including the Brain.  The
file is mtime-checked on each call so a REPL change takes effect immediately
inside a running Brain.  The agent has no tool that writes this file, so it
cannot disarm the gate.

IP <-> hostname bridge
----------------------
Bug-bounty manifests are almost entirely domain/wildcard/URL assets (~0
IP/CIDR across the cached set), but scanners and packet tools operate on
raw IPs/hosts.  The per-target verdict resolves in these tiers, first match
wins (out-of-scope always wins over an in-scope wildcard, mirroring
``program_scope.check_scope``):

1. **Operator allowlist** — IPs the operator blessed via ``scope add-ip``
   (authoritative and CDN-safe: the operator confirmed the IP by
   forward-resolving an in-scope hostname during recon).  This is the
   "passive OSINT allowlist" path.
2. **Manifest match** — :func:`auxiliaries.program_scope._find_match` against
   in-scope assets (DOMAIN/WILDCARD/URL for a hostname, CIDR/IP for an IP).
3. **Reverse-DNS attribution** (IPs only) — PTR-lookup and match the
   resulting hostname(s) against the manifest.  Tier 3 (PTR) is unverified,
   attacker-settable attribution; acceptance requires forward-confirmation
   (the PTR name must resolve back to the same IP).  CDN-hosted assets
   commonly PTR to the CDN, not the program domain, so this can
   false-negative; the operator falls back to tier 1 (``scope add-ip``) for
   those.

4. **IP boundary (optional, ``--ip-boundary`` at ``scope on``)** - when set and
   the operator has blessed >=1 IP, hostname targets that pass tier 1b/2 must
   forward-resolve into the blessed IP set; a manifest hostname asset that
   resolves outside it is refused (tier 3 PTR attribution is skipped for
   non-blessed IPs).  This is the drift guard from the 2026-09-20 fuzz-C
   finding: an explicit re-arm with a narrowed IP allowlist must supersede
   stale manifest hostname assets (a vhost whose DNS now points at a dropped
   host is refused, not waved through).  remove_ip also cascades: removing an
   IP purges blessed hostnames mapped to it.

Broad ranges (CIDR wider than /32, hyphen-ranges) can't be reliably
attributed host-by-host, so when armed they are allowed ONLY if the network
is a subnet of an explicit in-scope CIDR asset; otherwise they are refused
(broad subnet scanning is not a bug-bounty pattern — disarm for lab /
internal-network work).

Known limits
------------
The gate sees the REQUESTED target only — redirect-following (``ffuf -r``,
ZAP spider) and DNS-resolver traffic are out of its view.  amass /
subdomain_enum are program_scope-gated separately.  PTR tier-3 is
unverified, attacker-settable attribution; acceptance requires
forward-confirmation (the PTR name must resolve back to the same IP).

If no tier confirms in-scope and ``strict`` is True (default), the action
is REFUSED with guidance ("nada").  ``strict=False`` allows with a warning.
