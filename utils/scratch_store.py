"""Scratch store: durable, ownership-scoped storage for raw tool results.

The scratch store is the **raw evidence layer** — the durable home for full
tool outputs that are too large to enter the model's context window.  It is
NOT vector memory (no embeddings, no semantic recall) and NOT the findings
store (no reportable evidence lifecycle).  It is a deterministic,
reference-keyed store the model retrieves from via ``scratch_search`` when
it needs the full or filtered output of a prior tool call.

Design (see RFC 2026-10-01):
    scratch.db         metadata, ownership, expiry, indexes
    scratch-data/      compressed JSON payloads (0700 dir, 0600 files)

IDs are opaque random values (``scratch:<16-hex>``), never sequential, so a
guess from another chat cannot leak data.  Every entry is scoped to its
originating ``agent_id``; a valid-looking ref from the wrong agent returns
"not found", not the payload.

Persistence: entries survive a framework restart (on-disk).  TTL-based
expiry (default 24h, env ``SCRATCH_TTL_HOURS``) bounds disk growth; a
cleanup sweep runs on every ``store()`` call and is also safe to call
standalone.  The payload is written to a temp file, fsynced, atomically
renamed, then the metadata row is committed — a crash never leaves a
torn entry.

Per-entry cap: ``SCRATCH_MAX_PAYLOAD_MB`` (default 256).  Per-agent cap:
``SCRATCH_MAX_AGENT_MB`` (default 1024).  Both are soft-enforced at store
time; a result exceeding the per-entry cap is stored truncated with a
stated policy (the model is told what was dropped).

        This is the generic fallback projection — it operates on the

        - **List fields** (``open_ports``, ``rows``, ``recent_lines``):
          paged and filtered.  ``filter_pattern`` is a case-insensitive
          substring match; ``regex_pattern`` uses ``re.search``.
        - **Long string fields** (``body_head``, ``body``, ``log_text``):
          line-based grep.  Only matching lines are returned (plus
          ``context_lines`` adjacent lines when > 0).  This is the fix for
          web results — the model can pull just the CSRF lines out of a
          40KB HTML blob instead of getting a truncated first-16KB chunk.
        - **Short strings / non-list, non-string**: returned as-is.

        Tool-family digest adapters can produce richer projections, but this
        fallback ensures every stored result is retrievable without a custom
