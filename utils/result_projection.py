"""Result projection: control what enters model context vs. what stays in scratch.

The projection layer sits between ``execute_tool()`` and the result entering
the model's conversation history.  It operates in three modes:

    large   — (default) the raw result with every string field capped to
              ``LARGE_FIELD_CHAR_CAP`` chars and the total serialized size
              capped to ``LARGE_MODE_BYTE_CAP`` bytes.  When the result is
              under the cap it passes through unchanged (zero behavior
              change for small/medium results).  When it exceeds the cap,
              the full result is stored in scratch and the capped copy + a
              scratch_ref is returned — the model gets the actual data it
              needs (status, handles, headers, body previews) without a
              single response blowing up its context window.
    digest  — store the full result in scratch, return a compact per-tool-family
              digest + the scratch reference + the retrieval instruction.
    page    — store the full result in scratch, return a bounded page of the
              result (offset/limit) + the scratch reference + continuation info.

``full`` is gone — it was an unbounded passthrough that could deliver a
100KB+ response wholesale into a cloud model's context.  ``large`` replaces
it as the "give me the actual data" mode: same data shape, field-capped.
For backward compatibility ``full`` is silently aliased to ``large``.

The ``result_mode`` is an execution-envelope parameter — it is NOT a tool
argument and never reaches the tool body.  The gateway and the secretary
agent pass it alongside ``tool_id`` / ``arguments``.

Digest adapter registration
---------------------------
Tools that want a family-specific digest register a ``to_digest(raw_result)``
callable via ``@framework_tool(..., result_digest=my_digest)``.  The adapter
returns ``{"summary": str, "row_hint_format": str}`` — the projection layer
wraps it in the standard envelope.  Tools without an adapter fall back to a
naive head+count digest (a bounded preview, not a "real" digest).

Why this is NOT the parked OWUI trim filter:
    - The projection runs BEFORE the result enters context, not after.
    - The retrieval instruction is part of the return — the model is taught
      the move every call, never left guessing how to get the full output.
    - Per-tool-family digest logic is honest because the tool knows its own
      output structure; a generic post-hoc summarizer does not.

# --- Small-result passthrough threshold ------------------------------------

# check_scope returns a verdict, report_finding returns an ID) were never a
# context problem — storing them in scratch is wasted I/O and an extra
# retrieval round-trip for the model.  Only large outputs (nmap logs, ffuf
# hit lists, grep match dumps) trigger the digest/page projection.

# --- Large-mode caps -------------------------------------------------------
# ``large`` mode is the default for every lane (REST, MCP, secretary, OWUI).
# It behaves like the old ``full`` passthrough for results under the byte
# cap, but field-truncates + stores-in-scratch when a single response would
# otherwise blow up the model's context window.  Two knobs:
#
#   LARGE_MODE_BYTE_CAP  — total serialized JSON size (bytes) at which the
#                          result is stored in scratch and a capped copy is
#                          returned instead.  Under the cap = zero change.
#                          Default 16384 (16 KiB) — large enough for a full
#                          nmap port list + headers + a Burp body_text, but
#                          small enough that a 100KB HTML dump or a 50KB
#                          scan log can't enter context wholesale.
#
#   LARGE_FIELD_CHAR_CAP — per-string-field truncation length (chars) when
#                          the byte cap is exceeded.  Each string field in
#                          the result dict is truncated to this many chars
#                          with a ``...[truncated N chars]`` marker.  Lists
#                          are capped to the first N items where N is derived
#                          from the byte cap.  Default 4096.
#
# These caps are deliberately generous — ``large`` is "give me the data",
# not "summarize it for me".  ``digest`` is the summarize mode.  The caps
# exist so a pathological single response (raw HTML, huge grep dump) can't
# 6x the context window before anyone notices.

# --- Web-result HTML extraction adapter ------------------------------------
#
# Web tool results (session_get, session_post, session_request, session_upload,
# probe_web) carry the page HTML as a big string in ``body_head`` / ``body``.
# The generic _cap_result_fields truncates it to the first N chars, which is
# almost never what the model needs — it wants the *structured* content:
# forms (with their inputs + actions), links, script/src URLs, meta tags,
# and extracted CSRF tokens.  This adapter parses the HTML and returns those
# as list fields so the digest/page projection can page+filter them like any
# other list-bearing result, instead of treating the page as an opaque blob.
#
# The adapter is registered for the session_* tool IDs below.  It's used in
# digest mode (the model gets a structured summary, not a 40KB HTML dump)
# and as a scratch_search filter target (the model can grep for "form" or
# "csrf" and get the relevant structured rows, not a raw HTML line).
#
# BeautifulSoup is imported lazily — it's in requirements.txt but the module
# loads even if it's absent (degrading to a regex-based fallback).
