"""HTTP GET with per-hop scope-gate validation (redirect-bypass blocker).

The bypass this module closes (flagged by the operator 2026-09-19): a
tool validates its entry URL through the scope gate, fires the request,
the target answers 302 — and ``requests`` happily follows to a host the
gate never saw.  Redirects are attacker-controlled routing: a lab host
can 302 the client to an out-of-scope machine and the traffic fires
ungated.

:func:`gated_get` re-runs ``utils.scope_gate.check_scan`` on EVERY hop —
initial URL included — and raises :class:`ScopeGateError` the moment any
hop fails.  Callers that batch many URLs catch the error per-item (a
blocked probe is reported, never fired); single-URL tools let it
propagate as a hard failure.  Fail-closed in both shapes: no hop is ever
taken before its verdict.

All framework HTTP tools route through this helper (cors_probe, web_probe,
js_recon); archived_urls locks its endpoint by NOT following redirects at
all.

    """Arbitrary-method HTTP request with per-hop scope-gate validation.

    Generalises :func:`gated_get` to POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE with a body.
    Same redirect-bypass guarantee: every hop (initial URL + each 3xx
    target) is ``check_scan``-validated before the request fires; a
    cross-scope redirect raises :class:`ScopeGateError` (fail-closed).

    Redirect method handling follows common practice: 303 See Other always
    becomes GET with the body dropped; 307/308 preserve the original method
    and body; 301/302 preserve the method (servers vary; preserving avoids
    silently re-POSTing a payload to a redirect target the operator didn't
    bless — when in doubt, the gate catches an out-of-scope hop anyway).

    Set ``allow_redirects=False`` to send exactly one request and return the
    3xx response (no hop-following) — useful for SSRF probes that want to
    inspect a redirect body without following.

    Returns ``(response, hops)``; ``hops`` is the ordered list of
    ``{"url", "status", "method"}`` visited.
