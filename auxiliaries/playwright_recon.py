"""Playwright recon client: scope-gated rendered-DOM tools (sidecar API).

Client for :mod:`auxiliaries.playwright_sidecar` — the scope-enforcing
Chromium sidecar.  Mirrors the ZAP client pattern: thin ``@framework_tool``
wrappers that POST to the sidecar's loopback HTTP API and return structured
envelopes the secretary can act on.

Two tools:
  - :func:`playwright_fetch` — one-shot rendered-DOM envelope: final URL,
    status, title, visible text, links, forms, JS-discovered routes,
    ``blocked_requests`` (out-of-scope navigations/fetch/XHR/websockets the
    sidecar aborted), and ``challenge_detected`` (Cloudflare-class walls —
    honest flag, never faked).  Use for SPA recon where ``extract_js_routes``
    (static, no browser) can't see JS-rendered content.
  - :func:`playwright_crawl` / :func:`playwright_crawl_status` — launch/poll
    bounded crawl (nmap.py pattern): BFS over same-origin in-scope links up
    to ``max_pages``/``max_depth``/``wall_cap``, each page yielding the same
    envelope as ``playwright_fetch``.  Auth'd crawling via a persisted
    ``storageState`` (env-injected at sidecar launch, never a tool arg).

Scope: the entry URL is ``check_scan``-validated at the client BEFORE the
sidecar is asked to navigate (defense-in-depth — every other tool does this
too), AND the sidecar re-gates every navigation + fetch/XHR/websocket at the
browser request-routing layer (per operator policy, passive subresources are
allowed so pages render).  When the scope gate is DISARMED (lab mode) the
sidecar gates nothing — vanilla browser behaviour.

Honest limits (docstring is the contract):
  - ``challenge_detected`` flags interstitials but cannot solve them —
    vanilla only, no stealth patches (arms race; honest negatives).
  - The sidecar must be running (launched by ``bootstrap`` when
    ``PLAYWRIGHT_SIDECAR=1``).  If it is down, the tools return a clear
    error guiding the operator to start it — they never fake a result.
  - Passive subresource allowance means tracker CDNs can load; the
    programmatic request lane is where the scope boundary is enforced.
