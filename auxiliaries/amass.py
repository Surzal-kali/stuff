"""OWASP Amass v5 wrapper — subdomain enumeration via background job + poll.

Passive by default (amass v5's default mode).  Active, brute-force, and
alteration modes are opt-in via the ``options`` string with a flag allowlist.

This module mirrors the proven nmap ``run_nmap`` / ``nmap_status`` shape
using the shared :mod:`utils.background_job` helper:

- ``run_amass(target, options)`` launches ``amass enum`` as a background
  ``subprocess.Popen`` and returns immediately with a ``job_id``.  The
  secretary turn is NOT held open.
- ``amass_status(job_id)`` polls the job.  When the enum is done, it
  retrieves discovered names via ``amass subs -names -show`` (v5's
  retrieval path), falls back to a direct crt.sh CT-log HTTP query if
  amass found nothing, and optionally filters against program scope.
- ``subdomain_enum(target, options)`` is the composite launcher (same
  background job, marks the job for alive-check + structured output).
- ``subdomain_enum_status(job_id)`` polls, retrieves names, does scope
  filtering + DNS alive-check, and returns structured JSON.

amass v5 output model (v5.1+):
  Unlike v4, ``amass enum`` does NOT print subdomain names to stdout.
  stdout only gets a summary header ("Session Scope / FQDN: / <domain>").
  Results live in the engine's SQLite DB and session logs.  The correct
  retrieval path is:
    1. ``amass enum -d <domain>``  (writes to the default home DB)
    2. ``amass subs -names -show -d <domain>``  (prints names from home DB)

  **No ``-dir`` flag**: we intentionally use amass's default home DB
  (``~/.config/amass/asset.db`` under the running user) so that:
    - Results persist across runs and survive process kills (the home DB
      is checkpointed; a per-job ``-dir`` DB loses uncommitted WAL data
      on SIGTERM).
    - ``amass subs`` retrieves everything ever discovered, not just the
      current run's (possibly empty) per-job DB.
    - Accumulated data from prior completed runs is immediately available.

  This wrapper automates both steps.  Free CT/passive sources
  (certspotter, hackertarget, crt.sh) are layered as augmentation on top
  because different sources find different subdomains and crt.sh is
  frequently overloaded (502) for large domains.
