"""Concurrent web-surface prober: turn open ports into live HTTP intel.

Companion to the port scanners.  nmap/masscan answer "which TCP ports are
open"; this tool answers "which of those ports actually serve HTTP(S), and
what is it" — status code, title, Server/X-Powered-By fingerprints,
cookie-based stack hints, redirect chains — in ONE structured envelope, so
the secretary can decide where ffuf/ZAP/JS-recon go next without hand-curling
each host.

Origin note (honest): this box has NO projectdiscovery httpx binary.  The
``httpx`` executable in the framework venv is the Python ``httpx`` library's
curl-clone CLI (single-URL client, click-style options) — the wrong tool for
host probing.  Rather than depend on an install, the probe is implemented
directly with ``requests`` + a bounded thread pool.  If a PD httpx binary
lands on the box later, this module remains the gate-consistent frontend and
can grow a ``--engine pd-httpx`` passthrough.

Blocking by design and HARD-BOUNDED: targets x ports are capped (default
256 targets, 8 ports, 1024 requests), every request carries a per-request
timeout, and the whole run is wall-clock capped.  The dispatcher runs sync
tools in a worker thread, so a bounded blocking call is the intended shape
(AGENTS.md "Blocking Calls").

Scope: every entry in ``targets`` is validated by the operator-armed scope
gate (utils/scope_gate.check_scan) BEFORE any request fires — URLs and bare
hosts both parse; the whole run is refused if ANY entry is out of scope.
