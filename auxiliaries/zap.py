"""OWASP ZAP HTTP API client + framework tools.

Talks to a headless ZAP daemon (``zap.sh -daemon``) over its plain-HTTP API
(loopback only). The daemon is launched by ``bootstrap.start_zap_daemon`` and
exposes the API at ``http://127.0.0.1:<ZAP_PORT>`` with the configured
``ZAP_API_KEY`` sent as the ``apikey`` query parameter on every call.

Why HTTP-API rather than the ZAP MCP add-on
-------------------------------------------
The MCP add-on (port 8282) is fine but adds a second protocol layer the model
would have to reason about. The HTTP API has been stable since 2.x and gives
us exactly the primitives we want: spider, AJAX spider, active scan, alerts,
alerts by id, raw HTTP messages by URL, sites tree, and report generation.
We get "ZAP-as-grep" via ``zap_history_regex`` which calls ``core/view/getMessage``
to pull the raw response and runs a local ``re.search`` on it -- the model
can then ask things like "show me every form on the page that lacks a CSRF
token" without standing up a second LLM loop.

The client is a stateful singleton (``ZAPClient.get_instance()``) following
the same pattern as ``MetasploitClient`` -- this lets the Brain's instance
cache and the in-process fallback share one ``requests.Session`` and one
configured base URL / API key.

All public methods are wrapped as ``@framework_tool``-decorated module-level
functions so the static AST discovery pass + Brain scan both pick them up.
Sync only: every call hits a local daemon and never blocks longer than a
couple of seconds, but they're invoked in worker threads by both dispatchers
anyway, so we don't pay the async tax.

          requests per second to the target host.  ZAP 2.17+ supports this
          natively in the ``network`` component.
        - **Thread limits**: spider and active-scan threads are capped to
          a conservative number derived from the req/sec cap, so the rate
          limit isn't overwhelmed by concurrency.

        **Stale-rule cleanup**: all framework-managed rules (prefixed
