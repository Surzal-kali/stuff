"""sqlmap launcher + pollable status, mirroring the ZAP start/poll model.

sqlmap is inherently long-running: a real crawl+scan over many injectable
parameters can take minutes to tens of minutes. A *blocking* ``run_sqlmap``
holds the entire secretary turn open for the scan's full runtime and fights
the turn timeout no matter how large the budget. Instead this module uses the
same shape the ZAP tools already use (``zap_spider`` returns a scan id,
``zap_spider_status`` polls it):

- ``run_sqlmap(target_url, options)`` launches sqlmap as a background
  ``subprocess.Popen`` and returns immediately with a ``job_id`` plus a log
  file path. The secretary turn is NOT held open.
- ``sqlmap_status(job_id)`` polls the job: checks whether the process is
  still alive, tails the log, and parses a verdict (injectable / not
  injectable / still running) so the model can decide whether to keep
  polling or call ``report_finding``.

Non-interactivity is enforced defensively on two layers:

1. ``--batch`` is auto-injected when the caller omits it (sqlmap otherwise
   prompts on stdin: "do you want to test this URL? [Y/n/q]", ...).
2. ``stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`` so any future unsuppressed prompt reads EOF
   and never blocks.

A wall-clock cap (``SQLMAP_TIMEOUT``, default 1800s) reaps a wedged scan via
a ``threading.Timer`` so the subprocess can't run forever; the poll then
reports the timeout with the partial log.
